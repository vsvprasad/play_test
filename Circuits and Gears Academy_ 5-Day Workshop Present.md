    - Giving instructions to computers (apps, games, websites)
- **Activity:**
    - Introduction to Scratch: Create a simple animation or interactive story
- **What are Algorithms?**
    - Step-by-step instructions to solve problems (e.g., tie your shoes)
- **Hands-On:**
    - Design a simple Scratch game (character moves with keyboard)[^1][^2][^3][^4]

---

### **Slide 5: Day 3 – Introduction to Circuits \& Electricity**

- **Objective:** Understand how circuits work and power devices
- **What is a Circuit?**
    - Flow of electricity in a closed loop (battery, wire, light bulb)
- **Activity:**
    - Build a simple circuit to light a bulb
- **Exploring Sensors:**
    - How sensors detect motion or light
- **Discussion:**
    - Circuits in everyday electronics (phones, robots)[^1][^2][^3][^4]

---

### **Slide 6: Day 4 – Introduction to Robotics \& AI**

- **Objective:** Get familiar with robots and artificial intelligence
- **What is AI \& Robotics?**
    - AI: Machines learn and make decisions
    - Robots: Machines that perform tasks automatically
- **Activities:**
    - Program a robot (Dash \& Dot, LEGO Mindstorms) to move or follow a line
    - Group challenge: Teach your robot to complete a task (avoid obstacles, follow a path)
- **Discussion:**
    - How robots are used in factories, hospitals, space[^1][^2][^3][^4]

---

### **Slide 7: Day 5 – Final Project \& Presentations**

- **Objective:** Apply what you’ve learned to create and present a project
- **Brainstorming:**
    - Groups choose a problem to solve (build a robot, game, or machine)
- **Build \& Create:**
    - Use materials from previous lessons
- **Presentations:**
    - Each group explains their project and what they learned
    - Peer questions and feedback[^1][^2][^3][^4]

---

### **Slide 8: Materials Needed**

- Scratch programming platform (free online)
- Basic electronics kits (batteries, wires, bulbs)
- Robotics kits (Dash \& Dot, LEGO Mindstorms)
- Everyday objects (rulers, pencils, cups, books)[^1][^2][^3][^4]

---

### **Slide 9: Key Takeaways**
