## Extended High-Level Presentation: Introduction to Computer Programming with Simple Algorithms


---

### Slide 1: **Title**

**Introduction to Computer Programming**
Your Name
Date

---

### Slide 2: **What is Computer Programming?**

- The process of writing instructions that a computer can execute to perform tasks.
- Programs are written in *programming languages* that bridge human logic and machine execution.

---

### Slide 3: **Types of Programming Languages**

- **Low-Level Languages:** Close to hardware (machine code, assembly).
- **High-Level Languages:** Abstract away hardware details, easier for humans to read and write.

---

### Slide 4: **What is a High-Level Programming Language?**

- Uses human-readable syntax and symbols (e.g., `if`, `while`, `print`).
- Hides complex hardware details (memory management, CPU instructions).
- Focuses on *what* the program should do, not *how* it’s done at the hardware level.

---

### Slide 5: **Key Features of High-Level Languages**

- **Abstraction:** Simplifies complex operations.
- **Portability:** Code runs on different computers with little or no modification.
- **Productivity:** Faster, easier coding and debugging.
- **Automatic Memory Management:** Less manual work for programmers.
- **Rich Libraries:** Pre-built tools for common tasks.

---

### Slide 6: **Examples of High-Level Languages**

- **Python:** Simple syntax, used in web development, data science, AI.
- **Java:** Cross-platform, used in enterprise and mobile apps.
- **JavaScript:** Powers interactive websites.
- **C++:** Combines high- and low-level features, used in games and performance-critical apps.
- **Ruby, PHP, BASIC:** Other popular high-level languages.

---

### Slide 7: **How High-Level Languages Work**

- **Interpreted Languages:** Code is read and executed line by line (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- **Compiled Languages:** Code is translated into machine code before execution (e.g., C++, Java).
- **Transpiled Languages:** Code is converted from one high-level language to another (e.g., TypeScript to JavaScript).

---

### Slide 8: **Advantages of High-Level Programming**

- Easier to learn and use.
- Faster development and debugging.
- More focus on solving problems, less on hardware details.
- Code is more readable and maintainable.

---

### Slide 9: **Common Uses**

- Web development (JavaScript, Python)
- Data analysis and AI (Python, R)
- Game development (C++, C\#)
- Mobile and desktop applications (Java, C\#, Swift).

## NEW SECTION: Simple Algorithms


---

### Slide 10: **What is an Algorithm?**

- A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task.
- Algorithms are the foundation of computer programming.

---

### Slide 11: **Algorithm Example 1: Find the Largest Number**

**Problem:** Given three numbers, find the largest.

**Pseudocode:**

```
if a > b and a > c:
    largest = a
else if b > c:
    largest = b
else:
    largest = c
```

**Python Example:**

```python
a, b, c = 5, 8, 2
largest = max(a, b, c)
print("Largest number is:", largest)
```


---

### Slide 12: **Algorithm Example 2: Calculate the Sum of a List**

**Problem:** Add up all numbers in a list.

**Pseudocode:**

```
sum = 0
for each number in the list:
    sum = sum + number
```

**Python Example:**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(numbers)
print("Sum is:", total)
```


---

### Slide 13: **Algorithm Example 3: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**

**Pseudocode:**

```
if number % 2 == 0:
    print "Even"
else:
    print "Odd"
```

**Python Example:**

```python
number = 7
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")
```


---

### Slide 14: **Why Learn Algorithms?**

- Algorithms help you break down problems into logical steps.
- They are language-independent: you can implement them in any programming language.
- Mastering algorithms improves problem-solving and coding skills.

---

### Slide 15: **Summary**

- High-level programming languages make it easier to write and understand code.
- Simple algorithms are the building blocks for solving real-world problems.

---

### Slide 16: **Q\&A**


---

**Tip:**
Use visuals like flowcharts or step-by-step diagrams to illustrate how each algorithm works. This helps beginners grasp the logic behind the code.

---

This expanded presentation introduces both the concept of programming and basic algorithms, providing a strong foundation for beginners.
